## Dependancies
```
make
```

## Running
It still doesn't even do anything, why would you want to run it??? Anyway:
```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/cheese-chess/cheese_chess
# Go into the repo (duh, if you didn't know that, you shouldn't be compiling software)
cd cheese_c
# Run make to compile
make
# Then run it
make run
# If you want to install it, even if it doesnt do anything, run this as root (using sudo or doas or something, we really don't care):
make install
```
